      <h4 class="text-h4">A Vue/Vuetify centered crud exercise</h4>
      <p>This is a small project to take the rust off my fingers in regards to Front-end coding, and also try out Vuetify. Hopefully, it will be the first in a series of four different crud projects to use as practice.</p>
      <p>It was created following the requirements outlined in a technical test given to an acquaintance in an interview for a Junior Developer position.
        The API used to load each view's data was taken from said test, as well as the requirements for its use and general stylistic choices.</p>
      <p>Additionally, it was styled following a mobile-first approach and makes use of both Vue's composition and options API. </p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
